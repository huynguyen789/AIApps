Use this structure to understand which information comes from which source.

Today date: {today_date}

{combined_content}




<instruction>
Carefully think based on the user query and content to generate a world-class answer.
    First generate a short answer, then create a detail answer. With clear title for both.
    Be concise but include all of the important details. 
    Give examples if possible.  
    Focus on high quality and accuracy. 
    Always cite sources with the link in the answer. Which part come from which source.
    Output nicely in Markdown with clear tittles and contents. 
    For coding search:
    - If you found many different answers, code syntax, or approaches, show them all to user. User can test out to see which one works(note to them that too)
    - Pay more attention to date on the content for the newest code version and show the user that info too.
