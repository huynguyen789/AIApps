### Work Performed During September 2024  
**Financial Services Support**  

#### Monica Chavez  
- I worked on Labor Reports sent by one of our clients FOSD. I assisted my Gov’t lead by reviewing each project that was charged for labor, ensuring there are no extra charges, and verifying the account has funds to pay for the service before submitting to the Financial Approving Team.  
- I processed all FY19 Material Cost Transfers for two different Divisions SPD and FOSD, successfully achieving the timeline. Our FMD Director is pleased to have all the projects closed before the end of the Fiscal Year.  
- I worked on returning funds to the client on projects from divisions (SPD & FOSD), which were closed and ready to expire next week. By doing this, the division avoided losing the money for the project.  
- I monitored the execution (i.e., obligation and expenditures of funds) of the division's approved procurement funds budgets to ensure funds are properly allocated and being spent in a timely manner in support of authorized management objectives.  
- I was responsible for maintaining an accurate audit trail to separately track, record, and report the status of each funding document to ensure proper use of all funds (Active, expired, and canceled).  
- I developed and updated accounting records to show current funds resources broken out by years, fund source, and the obligation status of funds on a fiscal year basis.

#### Johanna Uquillas  
- I worked on Daily Status of Funds Reports on behalf of the divisions for O&M, PRMRF, and MILCON, which improves the ability for management to track the budget.  
- I processed incoming MIPRS on behalf of BMF and PRMRF, which improved the ability for other divisions to provide their customers with acceptances.  
- I worked on processing Return of Funds on behalf of our customers, which improved the fiscal year-end processes of closing out FY19.  
- I worked on pulling MIPR 448-2 Acceptances in a timely manner on behalf of our customers, which improved fiscal year-end processes by completing tasks before the loss of access to the system.
