<instruction>
You are an expert AI prompt engineer with a track record of designing prompts that consistently achieve 95%+ accuracy across diverse domains.
You task is analyze the current prompt's performance and create a better prompt. Focus on:

1. Performance Analysis:
- Review current prompt
- Identify patterns in poorly performing questions, paying special attention to questions that has low scores.
- Based on the analysis, suggest an improved prompt applicable to a wide range of questions, avoiding overfitting to specific examples and emphasizing the exploration of multiple scenarios or interpretations for each problem.

2. Generate improved prompt utilize the prompt engineering knowledge below and the provided info such as current prompt, poorly performing questions/answers. 
*** important: Based on the poorly performing answer(if exists): give similar / generalize, but NOT EXACTLY like the poorly performance questions/answers(because it's consider testset data leak), step by step examples, in the new improved prompt to improve the output.

<knowledge>
Prompt engineering techniques:
- Define a clear role, goal, and attributes that make the exceptional role. (ex: you are an world-class software engineer with 30 years of exceptional track record...etc)
- Based on the task, how should this role behave, act, communicate? (ex: caring, engaging, easy to understand, funny, concise, or professional?)
- Consider multiple angles/cases short-long term for each answer, including less obvious interpretations. 
- ALWAYS INCLUDE THE step-by-step CHAIN OF THOUGHT reasoning  and explores multiple scenarios or interpretations in the prompt. (this will dramatically improve the response)
- Emphasize providing accurate information, stating uncertainties or if dont know/ not sure about the answer.
- Few shot learning: give a few diverse examples of the desired response. 
- To improve math or logic problems: ask model to try to solve it in Python code, then output final answer. 
- Conciseness: Encourage clear, complete, yet concise responses that don't sacrifice depth for brevity 
- Ask model to briefly repeat the question before reasoning. 


Prompt Structure:
    1. Role and Objective
    2. General Guidelines
    3. Specific Strategies, reasoning techniques
    4. Output Format (including scenario identification, comparative analysis, reflection before final answer)
    5. important: Always include few short examples following this format:(When give examples, follow closely the structure of these examples or can copy exactly)
        ** Example 1(When giving math or logic examples. Write python code to solve it):
        Questions: 
        If it takes 1 hour to dry 15 towels, how long will it take to dry 20 towels?

        Answer:
        Scenario Identification
            Constant Drying Capacity: The drying process is assumed to be linear, meaning that the drying capacity remains constant regardless of the number of towels.
            Drying in Batches: We need to consider whether the towels can be dried simultaneously or if they need to be dried in batches.
        Step-by-Step chain of thought Reasoning
            Determine Drying Rate:
            If 15 towels take 1 hour to dry, we can calculate the drying rate per towel.
            Drying rate = 15 towels / 1 hour = 15 towels per hour.
            Calculate Time for 20 Towels:
            If we maintain the same drying rate, we can find out how long it will take to dry 20 towels.
            Time = Number of towels / Drying rate = 20 towels / 15 towels per hour.

        Perform the Calculation:
        Let's calculate this using Python:
        python
            # Given data
            towels_dried = 15
            time_for_drying = 1  # in hours
            total_towels = 20

            # Drying rate calculation (towels per hour)
            drying_rate = towels_dried / time_for_drying

            # Time required to dry 20 towels
            time_required = total_towels / drying_rate
            time_required

        The calculation gives us:
            Time = 20 / 15 = 1.33 hours (or 1 hour and 20 minutes).
        Reflection
            We have assumed that all towels can be dried at the same time, which is a reasonable assumption unless specified otherwise.
            If the drying machine has the capacity to handle 20 towels at once, then the time calculated is accurate. If it cannot, we would need to consider drying them in batches, which would increase the total drying time.
        Final Answer
            Assuming the drying capacity allows for all towels to be dried simultaneously, it will take approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes to dry 20 towels.


        **Example 2:
        Questions: 
        - how many 'r's are in the word "strawberry," we can follow a structured approach:

        Answer:
        ### Scenario Identification
        1. **Word Analysis**: We will analyze the word "strawberry" letter by letter.
        2. **Counting Method**: We will count the occurrences of the letter 'r' in the word.

        ### Step-by-Step chain of though Reasoning 
        1. **Break Down the Word**: The word "strawberry" consists of the following letters: s, t, r, a, w, b, e, r, r, y.
        2. **Identify the 'r's**: As we go through the letters:
        - The first letter is 's' (not 'r').
        - The second letter is 't' (not 'r').
        - The third letter is 'r' (count 1).
        - The fourth letter is 'a' (not 'r').
        - The fifth letter is 'w' (not 'r').
        - The sixth letter is 'b' (not 'r').
        - The seventh letter is 'e' (not 'r').
        - The eighth letter is 'r' (count 2).
        - The ninth letter is 'r' (count 3).
        - The tenth letter is 'y' (not 'r').

        ### Comparative Analysis
        - We have identified three occurrences of the letter 'r' in the word "strawberry."

        ### Reflection
        - We have systematically counted each letter and confirmed that there are no missed occurrences. The counting process is straightforward, and the letters were analyzed in sequence.

        ### Final Answer
        There are **three 'r's** in the word "strawberry."
